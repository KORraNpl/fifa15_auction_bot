# FIFA Auction Bot


Automated script for trading players in FIFA Ultimate Team. It was capable of moving bought players to trade list (giving them slightly higher price than they were bought for), relisting expired auctions and clearing sold players.


Script uses library fut written by @oczkers: https://github.com/oczkers/fut


It worked from December 2014 to February 2015, when EA Sports turned off web app for FIFA 15. I made quite a nice amount of FIFA coins with it ;)
